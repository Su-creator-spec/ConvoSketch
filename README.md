# ConvoSketch

Turning casual conversations into concise sketches of meaning.

---

##  Overview

**ConvoSketch** is an experimental project that explores how everyday conversations can be transformed into structured, meaningful summaries. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the repository demonstrates how dialogue can be distilled into concise "sketches" that capture the essence of communication.

This project is ideal for:
- Researchers studying **conversation summarization**.
- Developers experimenting with **NLP pipelines**.
- Learners exploring **Jupyter Notebooks** for applied AI.
